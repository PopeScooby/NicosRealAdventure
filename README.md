## Level Story/Script
### Opening (Pre-Game)
**Interior: Living Room**
  - Nico is Babysitting little brother. Tomlin is reading comic books.
  - Tomlin speaks…
    - **[Bubble1]:** “Hey Nico, check out this new comic I got. I found it at the thrift store. It’s really cool, it’s got wizards and aliens and ninjas and… everything.”
    - **[Bubble2]:** “At the end it says if I want to go on real adventure all I have to do is say these special magic words.””
  - Nico speaks…
    - **[Bubble1]:** “Hmm… Mom and Dad will be home soon but I think we probably have time.”
  - Tomlin speaks…
    - **[Bubble1]:** “OK, Here goes. (Insert magical sounding words). ”
    - **[Bubble2]:** “Did it work? I don’t feel any different.” 
  - A Blue Portal opens and a Wizard comes out, points a wand at Tomlin and pulls him into a crystal ball. Then he opens a Red Portal and runs away through it.
  - Nico speaks…
    - **[Bubble1]:** “Hey, come back here with my little brother.”
  - Nico Quickly follows the Wizard through the Red Portal 

### Level 1
**Exterior: Forest**
  - The Wizard comes out of a Blue Portal and runs off screen.
  - Nico comes out of the Blue Portal. A dialog bubble opens… 
    - **[Bubble1]:** “Where did he go? I’ve got to get Tomlin back and get home before our parents do or I’m going to be in serious trouble.”
    - **[Bubble2]:** ”Maybe that person saw something. I should go ask them.” 
  - An NPC can be seen Standing on screen fishing. When the player gets within a range of them (something the level will force) a dialog bubble opens.
  - PC Speaks…
    - **[Bubble1]:** “Excuse me. Where am I?”
  - Fisher Person Speaks…
    - **[Bubble1]:** “This is the Kingdom of GameWorld.”
  - PC Speaks…
    - **[Bubble1]:** “Did you see a Wizard run by here?”
  - Fisher Person Speaks…
    - **[Bubble1]:** “I sure did. He ran through that Red Portal up there.”
    - They pull out a device and it beeps. **[Bubble2]:** “You better hurry if you want to catch him though. Based on my calculations, that Red Portal is going to close soon.”
    - **[Bubble3]:** “I’ll tell you what. If you can find 5 Coins I’ll sell you this Timer and sync it to the unique frequency of the Wand that Wizard was using. Then it will tell you how long you have before the Portal they opened closes. If it closes before you get through I don’t see how you’d ever be able to track them down.”
  - If PC talks to them again before collecting 5 Coins...
    - **[Bubble1]:** “Sorry but I really can’t sell this for less than 5 Coins”
  - If PC talks to them while they have 5 or more Coins...
    - **[Bubble1]:** “Ahh, I see you have the coins. Would you like to buy the Timer?”
    - PC is Offered a Yes/No Dialog box
      - If No … **[Bubble2]:** “OK, Well, I’m here if you change your Mind”
      - If Yes… **[Bubble2]:** “Great, Thanks! Here you go. Good Luck kid!”
  - If PC talks to them again after buying the Timer…
    - **[Bubble1]:** “Hey, By the way. If you find a ???? bring it to me and I can trade you something good for it.”


### Level 2
**Exterior: Forest**
  - Nico comes out of a Blue Portal.  As he approaches the ledge there is an NPC
  - The NPC Speaks…
    - **[Bubble1]:** “Whoa. Careful there. You could hurt yourself on those spikes down there. If you do get hurt it’s really tough to find places to heal”
  - PC Speaks…
    - **[Bubble1]:** “Thanks. Have you seen a Wizard or a Red Portal around here?”
    
    
   
## Brainstorming session 3/14

**Action items**

- Andrew - Find visual of “2d lighting effect” and post on GG Discord

**Aesthetic**

- AdventureTime - weird vibes (or a softened Rick & Morty)


**Game Dynamics**

- Finding the right balance of hand-holding and clever easter-eggs
- Replay value - how do we make the game interesting using hidden features
    - Fire — burn away obstacles of hidden passages
    - Water — go into underwater areas by using enchanted bubble gum helmet
    - Earth — Underground areas from digging
- How do we introduce story points throughout the game, so that the player learns more and more about what’s really going on?

**Feature Ideas**

- Dark scenery/levels, with a findable item that gives off light and allows you to see through fog or darkness
- Enemies that follow you and try to catch using Godot’s pathfinding engine
- “Homing missiles” from enemies, lasers from spaceships
- Slingshot or firework as possible attack for Nico
    - Could primarily a feature for boss battles or later levels
- Pet falcon as a way to retrieve hard-to-get items
- Swarming rats beneath you
- Item wheel - used to select which item you’ve got selected
- Camera peek - allow the camera to move slightly relative to the character, to “peek” at the surroundings a bit
- Jumpshroom - ability to collect and place jumpshrooms, which increase the characters jump height
- Control jump height with duration of button press (e.g. briefly tap spacebar —> small jump)
- Bubble gum floating to influence jump behavior
- Canon to shoot you
- Sentient asteroids 
- Swimming
- Fishing (using a lure item)
    - Catch fish
    - Eat fish to get hearts
    - Heart container
- Fire
    - Burn away obstacles to reveal hidden passages, etc.
    - Cook edible items
- Dig (using a rusted shovel item) to dig loose dirt

**Possible plot/story**

- Four worlds
    - Fantasy — forest, cave, castle
        - You beat the wizard, and then you’re about to rescue some kids including your brother, but then everyone but you gets abducted by aliens
        - you go chasing them, which is you how get separated from Tomlin again
    - Sci-Fi/Aliens — Space ship, planet, moon, asteroid field
    - Ninja — Feudal Japan, cherry blossoms, ninjas are cats
        - Character change shape or form?  Becoming a dog temporarily
        - Nine levels, where you fight a mini boss at each level (since a cat has nine levels)
        - Level 10 — boss Mutant zombie cat head in jar
        - Hop into canon, get fired into level four 
        - You save your little brother, and have to decide
    - Big city (Cyberpunk?) — 
        - Level ideas
            - Pseudo cut-scene on the ground level (sneak into sewer behind the crow of angry people)
            - Start in the sewers
            - Rooftops
            - Elevators / stairs
            - 
        - “How is the cat getting to all these different places?!”
        - “Why did you take the canon? You could’ve just taken the bus.”
        - Ice climbers vibe (you and brother) or 
            - switch between Nico and Tomlin to have them both in a particular place for puzzles, etc.
            - Or just have younger brother just floating behind from bubblegum
            - Or just have Tomlin follow you
        - The Capitalist is the big-boss — 
            - Fossil fuel attacks, emanates oil fumes
            - Money

- The wizard is kidnapping kids and passing them to human traffickers
- For story intro, Nico is disinterested in younger brother until “oh shit” moment happens when wizard appears
    - “Ugh, my dumb brother, blah blah blah”
- 
- The complexity of enemy interactions and items increases as the levels go on
- At the end, you beat the wizard, and his wand accidentally goes off
